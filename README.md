# Chatroom React
React with socket.io chatroom

This project is the second version of [chat-room](https://github.com/BobbyLiu66/white-board) which seperated the front end from back end. Changing the front end from jQuery to React and Bootstrap. Because of I don't have much spare time to do this. I just finished main feature as a chat website and put it on ec2 apache. Next time I will upload it on s3 or google. This new version looks like whatsapp or some other kind of chat software but can be only add friend and chat one by one. I will continue doing this in the fulture.

## Update
I added some canvas feature make the main page look like not so boring any more and support login with Facebook account.
I changed the UI to a dark theme and change the logic about adding friend. The feature about upload avatar is not finished yet. So I just update the screenshot about the main page.

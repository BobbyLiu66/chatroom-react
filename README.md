# chatroom-react
React with socket.io chatroom

This project is the second version of [chat-room](https://github.com/BobbyLiu66/white-board) which seperated the front end from back end. Changing the front end from jQuery to React and Bootstrap. Because of I don't have much spare time to do this. I just finished main feature as a chat website and put it on ec2 apache. Next time I will upload it on s3 or google. This new version looks like whatsapp or some other kind of chat software but can be only add friend and chat one by one. I will continue doing this in the fulture.
